## Run locally
You can serve this folder statically and open the app in your browser.

- Option A: from repo root, run a simple HTTP server and navigate to `/rocket/viz/`.
- Ensure `rocket_traj.parquet` is at repo root (created by running `python rocket/rocket_sim_jax.py`).

Example (from repo root):

```sh
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/rocket/viz/
```

Or open `index.html` directly and click "Load sample" then select the file manually if cross-origin blocks the fetch.
